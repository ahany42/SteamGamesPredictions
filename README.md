## Predicting Videogame Review Scores on Steam

### 📊 Objective

This project focuses on analyzing and predicting user review scores for games and applications listed on the Steam platform using data from the **Gamalytic** Steam analytics client.

### 🧾 Description

Using two versions of datasets to apply classification and regression, we investigated the relationship between various game attributes and user sentiment. The goal is to identify the most influential factors that drive positive or negative user review scores on Steam.

### 🧩 Key Features Analyzed

- Supported platforms  
- Steam achievements  
- Trading card support  
- Workshop support  
- Game genre  
- Release date  
- Metacritic score  
- Game pricing  
- Publisher classification

## 🔍 Tasks

This project is split into two main tasks:

1. **Regression**  
   - Objective: Predict the actual user review score.  
   - Example models: Linear Regression, Random Forest Regressor, XGBoost, etc.

2. **Classification**  
   - Objective: Classify games as "positive" or "negative" based on their user review score.  
   - Example models: Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, SVM, etc.
